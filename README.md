# MacDownPlugins
Plugin(s) for MacDown.

This was the start of what was to be a few projects to create plugins for [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com).

It was derailed when I deduced that the MacDown plugin support was quite limited and, thus, I'd be better off writing a standalone Cocoa app and/or system services.

The plugin provided here does nothing, but has a bunch of notes in the source about how to write plugins for [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com).
